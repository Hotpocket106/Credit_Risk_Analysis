# Credit Risk Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing credit risk using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about loans and their corresponding credit risk.

## Dependencies
Python jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
## Data
The dataset used for this analysis can be found in the data directory. It contains information about loans such as loan amount, loan purpose, credit score, and credit risk. The credit risk is the target variable and is represented as a binary variable (1 for high risk and 0 for low risk).

## Code
The code for the analysis can be found in the src directory. It contains the following files:

data_preprocessing.py: Code for cleaning and preprocessing the data.
model_training.py: Code for training various machine learning models on the data.
model_evaluation.py: Code for evaluating the performance of the trained models.
visualization.py: Code for generating visualizations of the analysis.

## Results
The results of the analysis, including the performance of the trained models and the generated visualizations, can be found in the results directory.

Here we can see in this module, Easy ensemble adaboost classifer has significant more accurate machine learning results with the same dataset

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning techniques for analyzing credit risk. The results of this analysis can be used to identify high-risk loans and make informed decisions about lending.
